HOW TO PLOT CPU LOAD AND TASK EXECUTION TIME IN MATLAB?

1) Run a model with the Time Logger activated (in the configuration block)

2) Run the following command in your COM terminal to send the "TimeLogger" data to the FTP server:

	root@overo:~/RT_MaG_ToolBox/RT_MaG_Program# ./SendTimeLogger
	
	You recover in the FTP server an archive as following:
	
     + TimeLogger.zip
     |--- TimeLogger_Task0.csv : ';' delimited file with Task0' data
     |--- ... 
     |--- TimeLogger_TaskN.csv : ';' delimited file with Task0' data
     |--- top-output.txt       : text file with the CPU history of each PID (results of top command)
     |--- README.txt           : text file with instructions to plot these data in MATLAB

3) Unzip this archive and run in your Matlab command window (with the path of the unzipped directory as argument):
	
	>> ProcessCpuLoadLogger(<UnzippedDirectory>) 

	This function allow to visualize all the processus which where running onto the COM during the modele execution, and which CPU load corresponds to each processus.
	
4) Run in your Matlab command window (with the path of the unzipped directory as argument):
	
	>> ProcessTaskTimeLogger(<UnzippedDirectory>) 

	This function allow to visualize the interval between each step and execution time of each task.
